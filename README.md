# PacMan_Exercise

A small program where you can create one or more PacMan and it will run across the window in random directions. You will have two buttons "Add PacMan" and "Start Game" to play along with. "Add PacMan" will add one PacMan at a time to the window and you can add as many as you want, and "Start Game" will make the PacMan run faster and faster as you click the button.
